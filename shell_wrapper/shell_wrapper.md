# One-Shot Shell Wrapper

This is an interface for an Acumos AI4EU Component that wraps a tool that is typically called in a one-shot manner and produces at least one of each of the following input/output categories:

Inputs:

* command-line parameters
* input files
* standard input

Outputs:

* standard output and error
* output files

Importantly, standard input/output/error are seen as documents here and not as streams.
